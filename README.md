# vim-python
Python scripts for use with vim

These are a collection of python-scripts, which work with vim (if compiled so).
They give a structure to new files (for example perl.pl). Existing files get a date and time stamp and the user, who edited the file.

file structure:
~/.exrc ~/.vimrc ~/vim/config ~/vim/python
